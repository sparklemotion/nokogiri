  # Execute a block in the context of an object whose methods represent the
  # commands in a DSL.
  #
  # Use this method to execute an *imperative* DSL, which means that:
  #
  #   1. Each command mutates the state of the DSL context object
  #   2. The return value of each command is ignored
  #   3. The final return value is the original context object
  #
  # @example Use a String as a DSL
  #   Docile.dsl_eval("Hello, world!") do
  #   reverse!
  #   upcase!
  #   end
  #   #=> "!DLROW ,OLLEH"
  # @example Use an Array as a DSL
  #   Docile.dsl_eval([]) do
  #   push 1
  #   push 2
  #   pop
  #   push 3
  #   end
  #   #=> [1, 3]
  # @note Use with an *imperative* DSL (commands modify the context object)
  # @param dsl [Object] context object whose methods make up the DSL
  # @param args [Array] arguments to be passed to the block
  # @param block [Proc] the block of DSL commands to be executed against the

  #   1. The original DSL context object is never mutated
  #   2. Each command returns the next DSL context object
  #   3. The final return value is the value returned by the last command
