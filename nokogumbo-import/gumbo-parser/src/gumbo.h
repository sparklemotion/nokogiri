 * @mainpage Gumbo HTML Parser
 *
 * This provides a conformant, no-dependencies implementation of the HTML5
 * parsing algorithm.  It supports only UTF8; if you need to parse a different
 * encoding, run a preprocessing step to convert to UTF8.  It returns a parse
 * tree made of the structs in this file.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 *    GumboOutput* output = gumbo_parse(input);
 *    do_something_with_doctype(output->document);
 *    do_something_with_html_tree(output->root);
 *    gumbo_destroy_output(&options, output);
 * @endcode
 * HTML5 Spec:
