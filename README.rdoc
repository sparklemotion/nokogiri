== DESCRIPTION:

Nokogiri (鋸) is an HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser.  Among Nokogiri's
many features is the ability to search documents via XPath or CSS3 selectors.

XML is like violence - if it doesn’t solve your problems, you are not using
enough of it.

== FEATURES:

* XPath support for document searching
* CSS3 selector support for document searching
* XML/HTML builder

Nokogiri parses and searches XML/HTML very quickly, and also has
correctly implemented CSS3 selector support as well as XPath support.

== SUPPORT:

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'nokogiri'
  require 'open-uri'

  # Get a Nokogiri::HTML::Document for the page we’re interested in...

  doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open('http://www.google.com/search?q=sparklemotion'))

  # Do funky things with it using Nokogiri::XML::Node methods...

  ####
  # Search for nodes by css
  doc.css('h3.r a').each do |link|
    puts link.content
  end

  ####
  # Search for nodes by xpath
  doc.xpath('//h3/a').each do |link|
    puts link.content
  end

  ####
  # Or mix and match.
  doc.search('h3.r a.l', '//h3/a').each do |link|
    puts link.content
  end


== REQUIREMENTS:

* ruby 1.8 or 1.9
* libxml2
* libxml2-dev
* libxslt
* libxslt-dev

== ENCODING:

Strings are always stored as UTF-8 internally.  Methods that return
text values will always return UTF-8 encoded strings.  Methods that
return XML (like to_xml, to_html and inner_html) will return a string
encoded like the source document.

*WARNING*

Some documents declare one particular encoding, but use a different
one. So, which encoding should the parser choose?

Remember that data is just a stream of bytes. Only we humans add
meaning to that stream. Any particular set of bytes could be valid
characters in multiple encodings, so detecting encoding with 100%
accuracy is not possible. libxml2 does its best, but it can't be right
100% of the time.

If you want Nokogiri to handle the document encoding properly, your
best bet is to explicitly set the encoding.  Here is an example of
explicitly setting the encoding to EUC-JP on the parser:

    doc = Nokogiri.XML('<foo><bar /><foo>', nil, 'EUC-JP')

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install nokogiri

=== Binary packages

Binary packages are available for:

* SuSE[http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/ruby:/extensions/]
* Fedora[http://s390.koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=6756]

== DEVELOPMENT:

=== Developing on C Ruby (MRI)

Developing Nokogiri requires racc and rexical to generate the parser and
tokenizer.  To start development, make sure you have `libxml2` and `libxslt`
installed.

Then install hoe and rake-compiler:

    $ gem install hoe rake-compiler racc rexical minitest

Then run rake:

    $ rake

=== Developing on JRuby

Currently, development with JRuby depends on CRuby being installed.  With
CRuby, install racc and rexical:

    $ gem install racc rexical

Make sure hoe and rake compiler are installed with JRuby:

    $ jgem install hoe rake-compiler

Then run rake:

    $ jruby -S rake
