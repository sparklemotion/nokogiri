      # PushParser can parse a document that is fed to it manually.  It
      # must be given a SAX::Document object which will be called with
      # SAX events as the document is being parsed.
      #
      # Calling PushParser#<< writes XML to the parser, calling any SAX
      # callbacks it can.
      #
      # PushParser#finish tells the parser that the document is finished
      # and calls the end_document SAX method.
      #
      # Example:
      #
      #   parser = PushParser.new(Class.new(XML::SAX::Document) {
      #     def start_document
      #       puts "start document called"
      #     end
      #   }.new)
      #   parser << "<div>hello<"
      #   parser << "/div>"
      #   parser.finish

        # operating
