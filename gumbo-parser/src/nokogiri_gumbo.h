 * @mainpage Gumbo HTML Parser
 *
 * This provides a conformant, no-dependencies implementation of the
 * [HTML5] parsing algorithm. It supports only UTF-8 -- if you need
 * to parse a different encoding, run a preprocessing step to convert
 * to UTF-8. It returns a parse tree made of the structs in this file.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 *    GumboOutput* output = gumbo_parse(input);
 *    do_something_with_doctype(output->document);
 *    do_something_with_html_tree(output->root);
 *    gumbo_destroy_output(output);
