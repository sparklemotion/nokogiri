## 1.13.2 / unreleased

### Dependencies

* [CRuby] Vendored libxml2 is updated from 2.9.12 to 2.9.13. This update addresses [CVE-2022-23308](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/652dd12). Full changelog is available at https://download.gnome.org/sources/libxml2/2.9/libxml2-2.9.13.news
* [CRuby] Vendored libxslt is updated from 1.1.34 to 1.1.35. This update addresses [CVE-2021-30560](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30560). Full changelog is available at https://download.gnome.org/sources/libxslt/1.1/libxslt-1.1.35.news


## 1.13.1 / 2022-01-13

### Fixed

* Fix `Nokogiri::XSLT.quote_params` regression in v1.13.0 that raised an exception when non-string stylesheet parameters were passed. Non-string parameters (e.g., integers and symbols) are now explicitly supported and both keys and values will be stringified with `#to_s`. [[#2418](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2418)]
* Fix CSS selector query regression in v1.13.0 that raised an `Nokogiri::XML::XPath::SyntaxError` when parsing XPath attributes mixed into the CSS query. Although this mash-up of XPath and CSS syntax previously worked unintentionally, it is now an officially supported feature and is documented as such. [[#2419](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2419)]


## 1.13.0 / 2022-01-06

### Notes

#### Ruby

This release introduces native gem support for Ruby 3.1. Please note that Windows users should use the `x64-mingw-ucrt` platform gem for Ruby 3.1, and `x64-mingw32` for Ruby 2.6&ndash;3.0 (see [RubyInstaller 3.1.0 release notes](https://rubyinstaller.org/2021/12/31/rubyinstaller-3.1.0-1-released.html)).

This release ends support for:

* Ruby 2.5, for which [official support ended 2021-03-31](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/).
* JRuby 9.2, which is a Ruby 2.5-compatible release.


#### Faster, more reliable installation: Native Gem for ARM64 Linux

This version of Nokogiri ships experimental native gem support for the `aarch64-linux` platform, which should support AWS Graviton and other ARM Linux platforms. We don't yet have CI running for this platform, and so we're interested in hearing back from y'all whether this is working, and what problems you're seeing. Please send us feedback here: [Feedback: Have you used the `aarch64-linux` native gem?](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/discussions/2359)


#### Publishing

This version of Nokogiri opts-in to the ["MFA required to publish" setting](https://guides.rubygems.org/mfa-requirement-opt-in/) on Rubygems.org. This and all future Nokogiri gem files must be published to Rubygems by an account with multi-factor authentication enabled. This should provide some additional protection against supply-chain attacks.

A related discussion about Trust exists at [#2357](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2357) in which I invite you to participate if you have feelings or opinions on this topic.


### Dependencies

* [CRuby] Vendored libiconv is updated from 1.15 to 1.16. (Note that libiconv is only redistributed in the native windows and native darwin gems, see [`LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.md`](LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.md) for more information.) [[#2206](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2206)]
* [CRuby] Upgrade mini_portile2 dependency from `~> 2.6.1` to `~> 2.7.0`. ("ruby" platform gem only.)


### Improved

* `{XML,HTML4}::DocumentFragment` constructors all now take an optional parse options parameter or block (similar to Document constructors). [[#1692](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1692)] (Thanks, [@JackMc](https://github.com/JackMc)!)
* `Nokogiri::CSS.xpath_for` allows an `XPathVisitor` to be injected, for finer-grained control over how CSS queries are translated into XPath.
* [CRuby] `XML::Reader#encoding` will return the encoding detected by the parser when it's not passed to the constructor. [[#980](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/980)]
* [CRuby] Handle abruptly-closed HTML comments as recommended by WHATWG. (Thanks to [tehryanx](https://hackerone.com/tehryanx?type=user) for reporting!)
* [CRuby] `Node#line` is no longer capped at 65535. libxml v2.9.0 and later support a new parse option, exposed as `Nokogiri::XML::ParseOptions::PARSE_BIG_LINES`, which is turned on by default in `ParseOptions::DEFAULT_{XML,XSLT,HTML,SCHEMA}` (Note that JRuby already supported large line numbers.) [[#1764](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1764), [#1493](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1493), [#1617](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1617), [#1505](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1505), [#1003](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1003), [#533](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/533)]
* [CRuby] If a cycle is introduced when reparenting a node (i.e., the node becomes its own ancestor), a `RuntimeError` is raised. libxml2 does no checking for this, which means cycles would otherwise result in infinite loops on subsequent operations. (Note that JRuby already did this.) [[#1912](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1912)]
* [CRuby] Source builds will download zlib and libiconv via HTTPS. ("ruby" platform gem only.) [[#2391](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2391)] (Thanks, [@jmartin-r7](https://github.com/jmartin-r7)!)
* [JRuby] `Node#line` behavior has been modified to return the line number of the node in the _final DOM structure_. This behavior is different from CRuby, which returns the node's position in the _input string_. Ideally the two implementations would be the same, but at least is now officially documented and tested. The real-world impact of this change is that the value returned in JRuby is greater by 1 to account for the XML prolog in the output. [[#2380](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2380)] (Thanks, [@dabdine](https://github.com/dabdine)!)


### Fixed

* CSS queries on HTML5 documents now correctly match foreign elements (SVG, MathML) when namespaces are not specified in the query. [[#2376](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2376)]
* `XML::Builder` blocks restore context properly when exceptions are raised. [[#2372](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2372)] (Thanks, [@ric2b](https://github.com/ric2b) and [@rinthedev](https://github.com/rinthedev)!)
* The `Nokogiri::CSS::Parser` cache now uses the `XPathVisitor` configuration as part of the cache key, preventing incorrect cache results from being returned when multiple `XPathVisitor` options are being used.
* Error recovery from in-context parsing (e.g., `Node#parse`) now always uses the correct `DocumentFragment` class. Previously `Nokogiri::HTML4::DocumentFragment` was always used, even for XML documents. [[#1158](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1158)]
* `DocumentFragment#>` now works properly, matching a CSS selector against only the fragment roots. [[#1857](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1857)]
* `XML::DocumentFragment#errors` now correctly contains any parsing errors encountered. Previously this was always empty. (Note that `HTML::DocumentFragment#errors` already did this.)
* [CRuby] Fix memory leak in `Document#canonicalize` when inclusive namespaces are passed in. [[#2345](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2345)]
* [CRuby] Fix memory leak in `Document#canonicalize` when an argument type error is raised. [[#2345](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2345)]
* [CRuby] Fix memory leak in `EncodingHandler` where iconv handlers were not being cleaned up. [[#2345](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2345)]
* [CRuby] Fix memory leak in XPath custom handlers where string arguments were not being cleaned up. [[#2345](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2345)]
* [CRuby] Fix memory leak in `Reader#base_uri` where the string returned by libxml2 was not freed. [[#2347](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2347)]
* [JRuby] Deleting a `Namespace` from a `NodeSet` no longer modifies the `href` to be the default namespace URL.
* [JRuby] Fix XHTML formatting of closing tags for non-container elements. [[#2355](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2355)]


### Deprecated

* Passing a `Nokogiri::XML::Node` as the second parameter to `Node.new` is deprecated and will generate a warning. This parameter should be a kind of `Nokogiri::XML::Document`. This will become an error in a future version of Nokogiri. [[#975](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/975)]
* `Nokogiri::CSS::Parser`, `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer`, and `Nokogiri::CSS::Node` are now internal-only APIs that are no longer documented, and should not be considered stable. With the introduction of `XPathVisitor` injection into `Nokogiri::CSS.xpath_for` there should be no reason to rely on these internal APIs.
* CSS-to-XPath utility classes `Nokogiri::CSS::XPathVisitorAlwaysUseBuiltins` and `XPathVisitorOptimallyUseBuiltins` are deprecated. Prefer `Nokogiri::CSS::XPathVisitor` with appropriate constructor arguments. These classes will be removed in a future version of Nokogiri.


## 1.12.5 / 2021-09-27

### Security

[JRuby] Address CVE-2021-41098 ([GHSA-2rr5-8q37-2w7h](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-2rr5-8q37-2w7h)).

In Nokogiri v1.12.4 and earlier, on JRuby only, the SAX parsers resolve external entities (XXE) by default. This fix turns off entity-resolution-by-default in the JRuby SAX parsers to match the CRuby SAX parsers' behavior.

CRuby users are not affected by this CVE.


### Fixed

* [CRuby] `Document#to_xhtml` properly serializes self-closing tags in libxml > 2.9.10. A behavior change introduced in libxml 2.9.11 resulted in emitting start and and tags (e.g., `<br></br>`) instead of a self-closing tag (e.g., `<br/>`) in previous Nokogiri versions. [[#2324](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2324)]


## 1.12.4 / 2021-08-29

### Notable fix: Namespace inheritance

Namespace behavior when reparenting nodes has historically been poorly specified and the behavior diverged between CRuby and JRuby. As a result, making this behavior consistent in v1.12.0 introduced a breaking change.

This patch release reverts the Builder behavior present in v1.12.0..v1.12.3 but keeps the Document behavior. This release also introduces a Document attribute to allow affected users to easily change this behavior for their legacy code without invasive changes.


#### Compensating Feature in XML::Document

This release of Nokogiri introduces a new `Document` boolean attribute, `namespace_inheritance`, which controls whether children should inherit a namespace when they are reparented. `Nokogiri::XML:Document` defaults this attribute to `false` meaning "do not inherit," thereby making explicit the behavior change introduced in v1.12.0.

CRuby users who desire the pre-v1.12.0 behavior may set `document.namespace_inheritance = true` before reparenting nodes.

See https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Document.html#namespace_inheritance-instance_method for example usage.


#### Fix for XML::Builder

However, recognizing that we want `Builder`-created children to inherit namespaces, Builder now will set `namespace_inheritance=true` on the underlying document for both JRuby and CRuby. This means that, on CRuby, the pre-v1.12.0 behavior is restored.

Users who want to turn this behavior off may pass a keyword argument to the Builder constructor like so:

``` ruby
Nokogiri::XML::Builder.new(namespace_inheritance: false)
```

See https://nokogiri.org/rdoc/Nokogiri/XML/Builder.html#label-Namespace+inheritance for example usage.


#### Downstream gem maintainers

Note that any downstream gems may want to specifically omit Nokogiri v1.12.0--v1.12.3 from their dependency specification if they rely on child namespace inheritance:

``` ruby
Gem::Specification.new do |gem|
  # ...
  gem.add_runtime_dependency 'nokogiri', '!=1.12.3', '!=1.12.2', '!=1.12.1', '!=1.12.0'
  # ...
end
```


### Fixed

* [JRuby] Fix NPE in Schema parsing when an imported resource doesn't have a `systemId`. [[#2296](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2296)] (Thanks, [@pepijnve](https://github.com/pepijnve)!)


## 1.12.3 / 2021-08-10

### Fixed

* [CRuby] Fix compilation of libgumbo on older systems with versions of GCC that give errors on C99-isms. Affected systems include RHEL6, RHEL7, and SLES12. [[#2302](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2302)]


## 1.12.2 / 2021-08-04

### Fixed

* [CRuby] Ensure that C extension files in non-native gem installations are loaded using `require` and rely on `$LOAD_PATH` instead of using `require_relative`. This issue only exists when deleting shared libraries that exist outside the extensions directory, something users occasionally do to conserve disk space. [[#2300](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2300)]


## 1.12.1 / 2021-08-03

### Fixed

* [CRuby] Fix compilation of libgumbo on BSD systems by avoiding GNU-isms. [[#2298](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2298)]


## 1.12.0 / 2021-08-02

### Notable Addition: HTML5 Support (CRuby only)

__HTML5 support__ has been added (to CRuby only) by merging [Nokogumbo](https://github.com/rubys/nokogumbo) into Nokogiri. The Nokogumbo public API has been preserved, so this functionality is available under the `Nokogiri::HTML5` namespace. [[#2204](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2204)]

Please note that HTML5 support is not available for JRuby in this version. However, we feel it is important to think about JRuby and we hope to work on this in the future. If you're interested in helping with HTML5 support on JRuby, please reach out to the maintainers by commenting on issue [#2227](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2227).

Many thanks to Sam Ruby, Steve Checkoway, and Craig Barnes for creating and maintaining Nokogumbo and supporting the Gumbo HTML5 parser. They're now Nokogiri core contributors with all the powers and privileges pertaining thereto. 🙌


### Notable Change: `Nokogiri::HTML4` module and namespace

`Nokogiri::HTML` has been renamed to `Nokogiri::HTML4`, and `Nokogiri::HTML` is aliased to preserve backwards-compatibility. `Nokogiri::HTML` and `Nokogiri::HTML4` parse methods still use libxml2's (or NekoHTML's) HTML4 parser in the v1.12 release series. 

Take special note that if you rely on the class name of an object in your code, objects will now report a class of `Nokogiri::HTML4::Foo` where they previously reported `Nokogiri::HTML::Foo`. Instead of relying on the string returned by `Object#class`, prefer `Class#===` or `Object#is_a?` or `Object#instance_of?`.

Future releases of Nokogiri may deprecate `HTML` methods or otherwise change this behavior, so please start using `HTML4` in place of `HTML`.


### Added

* [CRuby] `Nokogiri::VERSION_INFO["libxslt"]["datetime_enabled"]` is a new boolean value which describes whether libxslt (or, more properly, libexslt) has compiled-in datetime support. This generally going to be `true`, but some distros ship without this support (e.g., some mingw UCRT-based packages, see https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/pull/8957). See [#2272](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2272) for more details.


### Changed

* Introduce a new constant, `Nokogiri::XML::ParseOptions::DEFAULT_XSLT`, which adds the libxslt-preferred options of `NOENT | DTDLOAD | DTDATTR | NOCDATA` to `ParseOptions::DEFAULT_XML`.
* `Nokogiri.XSLT` parses stylesheets using `ParseOptions::DEFAULT_XSLT`, which should make some edge-case XSL transformations match libxslt's default behavior. [[#1940](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1940)]


### Fixed

* [CRuby] Namespaced attributes are handled properly when their parent node is reparented into another document. Previously, the namespace may have gotten dropped. [[#2228](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2228)]
* [CRuby] Reparented nodes no longer inherit their parent's namespace. Previously, a node without a namespace was forced to adopt its parent's namespace. [[#1712](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1712), [#425](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/425)]


### Improved

* [CRuby] Speed up (slightly) the compile time of packaged libraries `libiconv`, `libxml2`, and `libxslt` by using autoconf's `--disable-dependency-tracking` option. ("ruby" platform gem only.)


### Deprecated

* Deprecating Nokogumbo's `Nokogiri::HTML5.get`. This method will be removed in a future version of Nokogiri.


### Dependencies

* [CRuby] Upgrade mini_portile2 dependency from `~> 2.5.0` to `~> 2.6.1`. ("ruby" platform gem only.)


## 1.11.7 / 2021-06-02

### Fixed

* [CRuby] Backporting an upstream fix to XPath recursion depth limits which impacted some users of complex XPath queries. This issue is present in libxml 2.9.11 and 2.9.12. [[#2257](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2257)]


## 1.11.6 / 2021-05-26

### Fixed

* [CRuby] `DocumentFragment#path` now does proper error-checking to handle behavior introduced in libxml > 2.9.10. In v1.11.4 and v1.11.5, calling `DocumentFragment#path` could result in a segfault.


## 1.11.5 / 2021-05-19

### Fixed

[Windows CRuby] Work around segfault at process exit on Windows when using libxml2 system DLLs.

libxml 2.9.12 introduced new behavior to avoid memory leaks when unloading libxml2 shared libraries (see [libxml/!66](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/merge_requests/66)). Early testing caught this segfault on non-Windows platforms (see [#2059](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2059) and [libxml@956534e](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/commit/956534e02ef280795a187c16f6ac04e107f23c5d)) but it was incompletely fixed and is still an issue on Windows platforms that are using system DLLs.

We work around this by configuring libxml2 in this situation to use its default memory management functions. Note that if Nokogiri is not on Windows, or is not using shared system libraries, it will will continue to configure libxml2 to use Ruby's memory management functions. `Nokogiri::VERSION_INFO["libxml"]["memory_management"]` will allow you to verify when the default memory management functions are being used. [[#2241](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2241)]


### Added

`Nokogiri::VERSION_INFO["libxml"]` now contains the key `"memory_management"` to declare whether libxml2 is using its `default` memory management functions, or whether it uses the memory management functions from `ruby`. See above for more details.


## 1.11.4 / 2021-05-14

### Security

[CRuby] Vendored libxml2 upgraded to v2.9.12 which addresses:

- [CVE-2019-20388](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2019-20388)
- [CVE-2020-24977](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-24977)
- [CVE-2021-3517](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3517)
- [CVE-2021-3518](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3518)
- [CVE-2021-3537](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3537)
- [CVE-2021-3541](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3541)

Note that two additional CVEs were addressed upstream but are not relevant to this release. [CVE-2021-3516](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2021-3516) via `xmllint` is not present in Nokogiri, and [CVE-2020-7595](https://security.archlinux.org/CVE-2020-7595) has been patched in Nokogiri since v1.10.8 (see [#1992](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1992)).

Please see [nokogiri/GHSA-7rrm-v45f-jp64 ](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-7rrm-v45f-jp64) or [#2233](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2233) for a more complete analysis of these CVEs and patches.


### Dependencies

* [CRuby] vendored libxml2 is updated from 2.9.10 to 2.9.12. (Note that 2.9.11 was skipped because it was superseded by 2.9.12 a few hours after its release.)


## 1.11.3 / 2021-04-07

### Fixed

* [CRuby] Passing non-`Node` objects to `Document#root=` now raises an `ArgumentError` exception. Previously this likely segfaulted. [[#1900](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1900)]
* [JRuby] Passing non-`Node` objects to `Document#root=` now raises an `ArgumentError` exception. Previously this raised a `TypeError` exception.
* [CRuby] arm64/aarch64 systems (like Apple's M1) can now compile libxml2 and libxslt from source (though we continue to strongly advise users to install the native gems for the best possible experience)


## 1.11.2 / 2021-03-11

### Fixed

* [CRuby] `NodeSet` may now safely contain `Node` objects from multiple documents. Previously the GC lifecycle of the parent `Document` objects could lead to nodes being GCed while still in scope. [[#1952](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1952#issuecomment-770856928)]
* [CRuby] Patch libxml2 to avoid "huge input lookup" errors on large CDATA elements. (See upstream [GNOME/libxml2#200](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/200) and [GNOME/libxml2!100](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/merge_requests/100).) [[#2132](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2132)].
* [CRuby+Windows] Enable Nokogumbo (and other downstream gems) to compile and link against `nokogiri.so` by including `LDFLAGS` in `Nokogiri::VERSION_INFO`. [[#2167](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2167)]
* [CRuby] `{XML,HTML}::Document.parse` now invokes `#initialize` exactly once. Previously `#initialize` was invoked twice on each object.
* [JRuby] `{XML,HTML}::Document.parse` now invokes `#initialize` exactly once. Previously `#initialize` was not called, which was a problem for subclassing such as done by `Loofah`.


### Improved

* Reduce the number of object allocations needed when parsing an `HTML::DocumentFragment`. [[#2087](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2087)] (Thanks, [@ashmaroli](https://github.com/ashmaroli)!)
* [JRuby] Update the algorithm used to calculate `Node#line` to be wrong less-often. The underlying parser, Xerces, does not track line numbers, and so we've always used a hacky solution for this method. [[#1223](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1223), [#2177](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2177)]
* Introduce `--enable-system-libraries` and `--disable-system-libraries` flags to `extconf.rb`. These flags provide the same functionality as `--use-system-libraries` and the `NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES` environment variable, but are more idiomatic. [[#2193](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2193)] (Thanks, [@eregon](https://github.com/eregon)!)
* [TruffleRuby] `--disable-static` is now the default on TruffleRuby when the packaged libraries are used. This is more flexible and compiles faster. (Note, though, that the default on TR is still to use system libraries.) [[#2191](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2191#issuecomment-780724627), [#2193](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2193)] (Thanks, [@eregon](https://github.com/eregon)!)


### Changed

* `Nokogiri::XML::Path` is now a Module (previously it has been a Class). It has been acting solely as a Module since v1.0.0. See [8461c74](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/commit/8461c74).


## 1.11.1 / 2021-01-06

### Fixed

* [CRuby] If `libxml-ruby` is loaded before `nokogiri`, the SAX and Push parsers no longer call `libxml-ruby`'s handlers. Instead, they defensively override the libxml2 global handler before parsing. [[#2168](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2168)]


## 1.11.0 / 2021-01-03

### Notes

#### Faster, more reliable installation: Native Gems for Linux and OSX/Darwin

"Native gems" contain pre-compiled libraries for a specific machine architecture. On supported platforms, this removes the need for compiling the C extension and the packaged libraries. This results in **much faster installation** and **more reliable installation**, which as you probably know are the biggest headaches for Nokogiri users. 

We've been shipping native Windows gems since 2009, but starting in v1.11.0 we are also shipping native gems for these platforms:

- Linux: `x86-linux` and `x86_64-linux` -- including musl platforms like alpine
- OSX/Darwin: `x86_64-darwin` and `arm64-darwin`

We'd appreciate your thoughts and feedback on this work at [#2075](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2075).


### Dependencies

#### Ruby

This release introduces support for Ruby 2.7 and 3.0 in the precompiled native gems.

This release ends support for:

* Ruby 2.3, for which [official support ended on 2019-03-31](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2019/03/31/support-of-ruby-2-3-has-ended/) [[#1886](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1886)] (Thanks [@ashmaroli](https://github.com/ashmaroli)!)
* Ruby 2.4, for which [official support ended on 2020-04-05](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/04/05/support-of-ruby-2-4-has-ended/)
* JRuby 9.1, which is the Ruby 2.3-compatible release.


#### Gems

* Explicitly add racc as a runtime dependency. [[#1988](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1988)] (Thanks, [@voxik](https://github.com/voxik)!)
* [MRI] Upgrade mini_portile2 dependency from `~> 2.4.0` to `~> 2.5.0` [[#2005](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2005)] (Thanks, [@alejandroperea](https://github.com/alejandroperea)!)


### Security

See note below about CVE-2020-26247 in the "Changed" subsection entitled "XML::Schema parsing treats input as untrusted by default".


### Added

* Add Node methods for manipulating "keyword attributes" (for example, `class` and `rel`): `#kwattr_values`, `#kwattr_add`, `#kwattr_append`, and `#kwattr_remove`. [[#2000](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2000)]
* Add support for CSS queries `a:has(> b)`, `a:has(~ b)`, and `a:has(+ b)`. [[#688](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/688)] (Thanks, [@jonathanhefner](https://github.com/jonathanhefner)!)
* Add `Node#value?` to better match expected semantics of a Hash-like object. [[#1838](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1838), [#1840](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1840)] (Thanks, [@MatzFan](https://github.com/MatzFan)!)
* [CRuby] Add `Nokogiri::XML::Node#line=` for use by downstream libs like nokogumbo. [[#1918](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1918)] (Thanks, [@stevecheckoway](https://github.com/stevecheckoway)!)
* `nokogiri.gemspec` is back after a 10-year hiatus. We still prefer you use the official releases, but `main` is pretty stable these days, and YOLO.


### Performance

* [CRuby] The CSS `~=` operator and class selector `.` are about 2x faster. [[#2137](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2137), [#2135](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2135)]
* [CRuby] Patch libxml2 to call `strlen` from `xmlStrlen` rather than the naive implementation, because `strlen` is generally optimized for the architecture. [[#2144](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2144)] (Thanks, [@ilyazub](https://github.com/ilyazub)!)
* Improve performance of some namespace operations. [[#1916](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1916)] (Thanks, [@ashmaroli](https://github.com/ashmaroli)!)
* Remove unnecessary array allocations from Node serialization methods [[#1911](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1911)] (Thanks, [@ashmaroli](https://github.com/ashmaroli)!)
* Avoid creation of unnecessary zero-length String objects. [[#1970](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1970)] (Thanks, [@ashmaroli](https://github.com/ashmaroli)!)
* Always compile libxml2 and libxslt with '-O2' [[#2022](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2022), [#2100](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2100)] (Thanks, [@ilyazub](https://github.com/ilyazub)!)
* [JRuby] Lots of code cleanup and performance improvements. [[#1934](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1934)] (Thanks, [@kares](https://github.com/kares)!)
* [CRuby] `RelaxNG.from_document` no longer leaks memory. [[#2114](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2114)]


### Improved

* [CRuby] Handle incorrectly-closed HTML comments as WHATWG recommends for browsers. [[#2058](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2058)] (Thanks to HackerOne user [mayflower](https://hackerone.com/mayflower?type=user) for reporting this!)
* `{HTML,XML}::Document#parse` now accept `Pathname` objects. Previously this worked only if the referenced file was less than 4096 bytes long; longer files resulted in undefined behavior because the `read` method would be repeatedly invoked. [[#1821](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1821), [#2110](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2110)] (Thanks, [@doriantaylor](https://github.com/doriantaylor) and [@phokz](https://github.com/phokz)!)
* [CRuby] Nokogumbo builds faster because it can now use header files provided by Nokogiri. [[#1788](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1788)] (Thanks, [@stevecheckoway](https://github.com/stevecheckoway)!)
* Add `frozen_string_literal: true` magic comment to all `lib` files. [[#1745](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1745)] (Thanks, [@oniofchaos](https://github.com/oniofchaos)!)
* [JRuby] Clean up deprecated calls into JRuby. [[#2027](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2027)] (Thanks, [@headius](https://github.com/headius)!)


### Fixed

* HTML Parsing in "strict" mode (i.e., the `RECOVER` parse option not set) now correctly raises a `XML::SyntaxError` exception. Previously the value of the `RECOVER` bit was being ignored by CRuby and was misinterpreted by JRuby. [[#2130](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2130)]
* The CSS `~=` operator now correctly handles non-space whitespace in the `class` attribute. commit e45dedd
* The switch to turn off the CSS-to-XPath cache is now thread-local, rather than being shared mutable state. [[#1935](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1935)]
* The Node methods `add_previous_sibling`, `previous=`, `before`, `add_next_sibling`, `next=`, `after`, `replace`, and `swap` now correctly use their parent as the context node for parsing markup. These methods now also raise a `RuntimeError` if they are called on a node with no parent. [[nokogumbo#160](https://github.com/rubys/nokogumbo/issues/160)]
* [JRuby] `XML::Schema` XSD validation errors are captured in `XML::Schema#errors`. These errors were previously ignored.
* [JRuby] Standardize reading from IO like objects, including StringIO. [[#1888](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1888), [#1897](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1897)]
* [JRuby] Fix how custom XPath function namespaces are inferred to be less naive. [[#1890](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1890), [#2148](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2148)]
* [JRuby] Clarify exception message when custom XPath functions can't be resolved.
* [JRuby] Comparison of Node to Document with `Node#<=>` now matches CRuby/libxml2 behavior.
* [CRuby] Syntax errors are now correctly captured in `Document#errors` for short HTML documents. Previously the SAX parser used for encoding detection was clobbering libxml2's global error handler.
* [CRuby] Fixed installation on AIX with respect to `vasprintf`. [[#1908](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1908)]
* [CRuby] On some platforms, avoid symbol name collision with glibc's `canonicalize`. [[#2105](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2105)]
* [Windows Visual C++] Fixed compiler warnings and errors. [[#2061](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2061), [#2068](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2068)]
* [CRuby] Fixed Nokogumbo integration which broke in the v1.11.0 release candidates. [[#1788](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1788)] (Thanks, [@stevecheckoway](https://github.com/stevecheckoway)!)
* [JRuby] Fixed document encoding regression in v1.11.0 release candidates. [[#2080](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2080), [#2083](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2083)] (Thanks, [@thbar](https://github.com/thbar)!)


### Removed

* The internal method `Nokogiri::CSS::Parser.cache_on=` has been removed. Use `.set_cache` if you need to muck with the cache internals.
* The class method `Nokogiri::CSS::Parser.parse` has been removed. This was originally deprecated in 2009 in 13db61b. Use `Nokogiri::CSS.parse` instead.


### Changed

#### `XML::Schema` input is now "untrusted" by default

Address [CVE-2020-26247](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-vr8q-g5c7-m54m).

In Nokogiri versions <= 1.11.0.rc3, XML Schemas parsed by `Nokogiri::XML::Schema` were **trusted** by default, allowing external resources to be accessed over the network, potentially enabling XXE or SSRF attacks.

This behavior is counter to the security policy intended by Nokogiri maintainers, which is to treat all input as **untrusted** by default whenever possible.

Please note that this security fix was pushed into a new minor version, 1.11.x, rather than a patch release to the 1.10.x branch, because it is a breaking change for some schemas and the risk was assessed to be "Low Severity".

More information and instructions for enabling "trusted input" behavior in v1.11.0.rc4 and later is available at the [public advisory](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-vr8q-g5c7-m54m).


#### HTML parser now obeys the `strict` or `norecover` parsing option

(Also noted above in the "Fixed" section) HTML Parsing in "strict" mode (i.e., the `RECOVER` parse option not set) now correctly raises a `XML::SyntaxError` exception. Previously the value of the `RECOVER` bit was being ignored by CRuby and was misinterpreted by JRuby.

If you're using the default parser options, you will be unaffected by this fix. If you're passing `strict` or `norecover` to your HTML parser call, you may be surprised to see that the parser now fails to recover and raises a `XML::SyntaxError` exception. Given the number of HTML documents on the internet that libxml2 would consider to be ill-formed, this is probably not what you want, and you can omit setting that parse option to restore the behavior that you have been relying upon.

Apologies to anyone inconvenienced by this breaking bugfix being present in a minor release, but I felt it was appropriate to introduce this fix because it's straightforward to fix any code that has been relying on this buggy behavior.


#### `VersionInfo`, the output of `nokogiri -v`, and related constants

This release changes the metadata provided in `Nokogiri::VersionInfo` which also affects the output of `nokogiri -v`. Some related constants have also been changed. If you're using `VersionInfo` programmatically, or relying on constants related to underlying library versions, please read the detailed changes for `Nokogiri::VersionInfo` at [#2139](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2139) and accept our apologies for the inconvenience.


## 1.10.10 / 2020-07-06

### Features

* [MRI] Cross-built Windows gems now support Ruby 2.7 [[#2029](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2029)]. Note that prior to this release, the v1.11.x prereleases provided this support.


## 1.10.9 / 2020-03-01

### Fixed

* [MRI] Raise an exception when Nokogiri detects a specific libxml2 edge case involving blank Schema nodes wrapped by Ruby objects that would cause a segfault. Currently no fix is available upstream, so we're preventing a dangerous operation and informing users to code around it if possible. [[#1985](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1985), [#2001](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/2001)]
* [JRuby] Change `NodeSet#to_a` to return a RubyArray instead of Object, for compilation under JRuby 9.2.9 and later. [[#1968](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1968), [#1969](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1969)] (Thanks, [@headius](https://github.com/headius)!)

## 1.10.4 / 2019-08-11

### Security

Address CVE-2019-5477 ([#1915](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1915)).

A command injection vulnerability in Nokogiri v1.10.3 and earlier allows commands to be executed in a subprocess by Ruby's `Kernel.open` method. Processes are vulnerable only if the undocumented method `Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file` is being passed untrusted user input.

This vulnerability appears in code generated by the Rexical gem versions v1.0.6 and earlier. Rexical is used by Nokogiri to generate lexical scanner code for parsing CSS queries. The underlying vulnerability was addressed in Rexical v1.0.7 and Nokogiri upgraded to this version of Rexical in Nokogiri v1.10.4.

This CVE's public notice is [#1915](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1915)


## 1.10.3 / 2019-04-22

### Security

* `NodeSet#attr` now returns `nil` if it's empty. Previously this raised a NoMethodError.
* [MRI] XPath errors are no longer suppressed during `XSLT::Stylesheet#transform`. Previously these errors were suppressed which led to silent failures and a subsequent segfault. [[#1802](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1802)]


## 1.10.0 / 2019-01-04

### Added

* [MRI] Cross-built Windows gems now support Ruby 2.6 [[#1842](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1842), [#1850](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1850)]

## 1.9.1 / 2018-12-17

### Fixed

* Fix a bug introduced in v1.9.0 where `XML::DocumentFragment#dup` no longer returned an instance of the callee's class, instead always returning an `XML::DocumentFragment`. This notably broke any subclass of `XML::DocumentFragment` including `HTML::DocumentFragment` as well as the Loofah gem's `Loofah::HTML::DocumentFragment`. [[#1846](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1846)]


## 1.9.0 / 2018-12-17

### Security

* [JRuby] Upgrade Xerces dependency from 2.11.0 to 2.12.0 to address upstream vulnerability CVE-2012-0881 [[#1831](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1831)] (Thanks [@grajagandev](https://github.com/grajagandev) for reporting.)

* [MRI] Improve installation experience on macOS High Sierra (Darwin). [[#1812](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1812), [#1813](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1813)] (Thanks, [@gpakosz](https://github.com/gpakosz) and [@nurse](https://github.com/nurse)!)
* [MRI] `Node#dup` supports copying a node directly to a new document. See the method documentation for details.
* [MRI] `DocumentFragment#dup` is now more memory-efficient, avoiding making unnecessary copies. [[#1063](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1063)]
* [JRuby] `NodeSet` has been rewritten to improve performance! [[#1795](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1795)]

## 1.6.8.1 / 2016-10-03

### Dependencies

Removes required dependency on the `pkg-config` gem. This dependency
was introduced in v1.6.8 and, because it's distributed under LGPL, was
objectionable to many Nokogiri users ([#1488](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1488), [#1496](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1496)).

This version makes `pkg-config` an optional dependency. If it's
installed, it's used; but otherwise Nokogiri will attempt to work
around its absence.


## 1.6.8 / 2016-06-06

### Security

[MRI] Bundled libxml2 is upgraded to 2.9.4, which fixes many security issues. Many of these had previously been patched in the vendored libxml 2.9.2 in the 1.6.7.x branch, but some are newer.

See these libxml2 email posts for more:

* https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2015-November/msg00012.html
* https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2016-May/msg00023.html
